\title{Enhanced Guo-Hall Thinning Algorithm
Thin Binary Image using Guo-Hall Algorithm (Internal)}
\usage{
thin_image_guohall(img, verbose = FALSE, select.layer = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{img}{A matrix, data frame, or `SpatRaster` object representing the binary image to be thinned.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If `TRUE`, outputs diagnostic information such as image dimensions, pixel removal counts, and iteration progress. Default is `FALSE`.}

\item{select.layer}{Integer indicating the layer to use if `img` is a multi-layer `SpatRaster`. Default is 2.}
}
\value{
A binary matrix representing the thinned image (skeleton).
}
\description{
This internal function applies the Guo-Hall thinning algorithm to reduce binary images to their skeletons while preserving connectivity and structure.
}
\details{
- The input image is first processed using \code{\link{load_flexible_image}} to ensure it is a binary matrix.
- Thinning is performed in an iterative process consisting of two subiterations per cycle:
  1. In the first subiteration, pixels are marked for removal based on specific Guo-Hall conditions.
  2. In the second subiteration, a different set of conditions is applied to mark additional pixels for removal.
- The process continues until no pixels are removed in an iteration or the maximum number of iterations (default: 1000) is reached.
- The Guo-Hall algorithm ensures that the skeleton of the image is preserved.
