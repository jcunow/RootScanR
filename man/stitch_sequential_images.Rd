\title{Stitch Sequential Images}
\usage{
stitch_sequential_images(
  imgs,
  overlap_px = 200,
  side1 = "bottom",
  method = "crosscorr"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{imgs}{A character vector of file paths to the images to be stitched.}

\item{overlap_px}{An integer specifying the number of pixels to use to search for overlap between images. Default is 200. The CI-600 scanner produces 100-200 px overlap at 300dpi.}

\item{side1}{A string specifying the side of the previous image used for overlap (e.g., "bottom", "top", "left", "right"). Default is "bottom".}

\item{method}{A string specifying the method for alignment, either "crosscorr" or "phasecorr". Default is "crosscorr".}
}
\value{
A stitched image as a cimg object.
}
\description{
This function stitches a sequence of images together by aligning overlapping regions based on cross-correlation or phase-correlation.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
imgs <- c("image1.jpg", "image2.jpg", "image3.jpg")
stitched <- stitch_sequential_images(imgs = imgs,
                    overlap_px = 250, side1 = "bottom")
}
